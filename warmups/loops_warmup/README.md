The loops_warmup was created to practie with for loops - the premise of this warm up was to loop through from 0 - 100 and print out even or odd. 

Using a for loop starting from 0, with an if conditional and number that was able to be divided using a modulo by 2 with no remainder would print even, with a remainder of 1 would print odd, and if it reached the else would print zero
