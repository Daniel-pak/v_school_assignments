This warm up was created to practice with functions. The premise of the exercise was to create a function that would properly change any string into camelCase. Note: this function will throw an error for double spaces, hyphens or underscores. 

The function camelCase accepts a string as an argument and turns the string to all lower case as well as splits the string into an array.

The function then puts this newly created array and runs a for loop on it, checking for spaces/hyphens/underscores. If these are met and the a space/hyphen/underscore doesn't follow, it creates an uppercase for the next item and pushes that into our newly created array. 

Then the function joins together each of the letters of the strings and console logs the final product.
