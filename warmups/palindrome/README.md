The palindrome warmup was created to practice with functions and conditionals. 

the palindrome function takes a string parameter, changes the case to lower, and checks the length of the string. 

The function runs a for loop that, based on the declared alphanumeric string that was declared, would remove any spaces, hyphens, underscores and other miscellaneous items. 

The function then would run a specific logic based on the length of the newly made string and return a boolean value based on the logic.
