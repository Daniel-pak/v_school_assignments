The first repeat warm up was created to practice with building functions and conditionals. 

The premise of this warm up was to create a function that would find repeats of letter in the string and return the non repeats. 

The firstRepeat function takes a string parameter and creates 2 empty arrays - empty and dupes, to hold both the single and the duplicate characters. Using a for loop, the function checks if the letter at the specific iteration has a different number for the indexOf() method and the lastIndexof() method. If this number was the same it mean it was a single letter and would be pushed to the empty array, otherwise it would move to the else if function and push the letter to the dupes array and return the empty array.
