The bootstrap_warmup was created to practice with the fundamentals of the bootstrap grid system and some components.

The premise called for certain necessities to be met such as - buttons, navbar, 2 glyphicons and a centered h1 tag. 

I created a mock personal portolio site using the grid system to center everything and added badly placed glyphicons to practice using them. The navbar was created using the navbar class names. 

This warmup was a lot of fun and allowed for a lot of creativity - I really enjoyed the entire process and I hope you enjoy the page!
