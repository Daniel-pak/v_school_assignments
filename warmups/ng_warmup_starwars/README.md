This warm up was createed to practice with angular and http requests to get the star wars crawling title and put them on the screen.

The components: 
The index.html helps create the view for the controller by adding the correct tags.
Also, by adding the audio tags, I was able to add the opening track to starwars. 

Styles.css 
helps style the view by creating the 3D effect and having a star background. 

app.js
Uses the $http service to grab the crawling opening titles from the starwars movies and sets the response to a scope item which is then displayed on the view.
