The count code warmup was created with the parameters that we accept a random string and count how many times the string "code" is found in this string. However, the function should also count words with any letter in the index 2 spot - for example coxe.

The codeCount was created to do this with regex - the expression to match was created and then using the .match() method with the .length method attached it returns the count that is now saved in the matchCount variable.
