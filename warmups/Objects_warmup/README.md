This warm up was created to warm up for the day with conditionals and functions. 

The first function - lowerNumber - was created to return the lower number of the two parameters that are passed to it. 

The second function - troubleBrewing - to check if either monkey was smiling - a or b - if they both are or both aren't then return a true statement (meaning the monkies will attack so RUN!)

The third function was created to check the time by creating a new Date Object and then respond with a proper greeting - Good Morning, Good Afternoon or Good Evening.
