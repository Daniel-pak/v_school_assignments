The Print_date warmup was created to warm up for the day by working with functions and the date object. 

The parameters of the warmup was to create a console.log statement that returns: "Current time is: {hour}: {minute}: {second} AM/PM and the day of the week

For this warm up, a new date object was created and the getDay() method was used to grab the day. Then the function dayOfTheWeek was used as a switch function to choose the day based on the returned number of the getDay method. Then using my date method, I was able to grab the time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Finally dayOfTheWeek and printTime functions were used to print out both the day and the time.
