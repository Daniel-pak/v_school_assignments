The node_adventure warm up was created to practice with Node. Using readline sync, the premise of the warmup is to start an adventure game. 

This was done in 3 parts 
Part 1: The introduction gives you a greeting and asks a question method() which you will respond with a number. 

Part 2: Takes this number and gives you dialog based on this number, which then asks you a question which you must answer with a number. 

Part 3: Takes into account the first number and the second number and gives you a dialog story based on the combination.
