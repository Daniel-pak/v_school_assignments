This warm up was created to work with conditionals and functions. 

The premise of the warm up was to create a function that would take an array of "stock prices" and return the highest possible return of profit. 

This was done by creating a function that would use 2 for loops to track the first number and the numbers following and track the highest difference. Then by returning this difference it would accomplish the task.
