This exercise was created to practice with the ng-repeat directive. 

The premise of this exercise was to create a webpage that would show a gamers kills - for each kill you would show the Handle, Rank and Clan Members in an array. 

The exercise allowed for a solid foundation of ng-repeat and it's uses.
