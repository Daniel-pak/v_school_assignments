This exercise was created to become familiar with jQuery and it's syntax. 

The purpose of this exercise was to recreate a previous project - Mario Pest Control - with jQuery to add more interactivity. 

The exercise allowed me to learn how to use audio with event handlers and use selectors to manipulate the DOM.
