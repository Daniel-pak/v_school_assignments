This exercise was created to work with all the previously known services and directives. 

The premise of this exercise was to create a bootstrapped application that would allow users to create classic name badges with ng-model, ng-repeat and the $scope service. 

The exercise allowed for great practice with the bootstrap grid system and basic CSS styling. For angular purposes, this exercise was a great beginning foundation to necessary angular application parts.
