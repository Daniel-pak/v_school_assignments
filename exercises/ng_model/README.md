This exercise was created to work with the ng-model directive. 

The premise of the exercise was to create a webpage that would have 3 input boxes that would show the inputs - Name, favorite color and favorite activity. 

The exercise allowed for a good understanding of the ng-model and it's uses. The solid foundation allowed me to use this in many different applications.
