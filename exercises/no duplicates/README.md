This exercise was created to practice with functions and conditionals. 

The premise of the exercise is to create a function that will take a string parameter and separate the letters by either categories of duplicate or single use. 

The exercise allowed for a good understanding of string manipulation and string creation with operators. As well as good practice with for loops.
