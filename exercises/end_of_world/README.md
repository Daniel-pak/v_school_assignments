This exercise was designed to practice with the basic fundamentals of creating a front end project. 
The premise of this exercise was to create a page that has a count down timer that counts down to 0 and then sets of an alarm. 

The exercise taught the importance of setInterval and setTimeOut as well as callbacks. 
Along with this, it familiarized me with the html audio tags and setting a perfectly fit background as a picture.
