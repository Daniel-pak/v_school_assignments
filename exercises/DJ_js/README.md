The premise of this exercise was: 
You're starting your business as a strictly online DJ (DJ JS) and you want to start by creating a website where people can change the color of a square on the page by interacting with different HTML Events.

The exercise was created to practice with these event handlers and css changes used with said event handlers. 

The square changes to: 
Blue when the mouse hovers over the square
Red when the mouse button is held down over the square
Yellow when the mouse button is let go over the square
Green when the mouse is double clicked in the square
Orange when the mouse scroll is used somewhere in the window (not over the square).
