This exercise was created to work with the $http and $scope service as well as the ng-repeat directive. 

The premise of the exercise was to create a webpage that would show the pictures, names and a description of each item on a hitlist in a bootstraped webpage that was well designed. 

The exercise allowed for practice with these services and greatly aided me in solidifying a good understanding of the syntax of these services and directives.
