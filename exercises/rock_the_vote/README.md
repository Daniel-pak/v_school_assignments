This exercise was created to practice with angular services and directives - especially building our own services. In addition, to practice with our own created servers and databases. 

The premise of the exercise was to create a webpage that would allow users to input a hot political debate topic that would then be able to be upvoted or downvoted and commented on. These items would all be saved on our own server.

An exercise further down the road required that we go back to the exercise and add a database with MongoDB so that the information would stay even when the page refreshed & the server went down. 

This exercise was great practice for learning the syntax of the early stages of building a database.
