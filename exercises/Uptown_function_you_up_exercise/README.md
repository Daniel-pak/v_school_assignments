This exercise was created to practice with Array manipulation and methods. 
The premise of the exercise was to create functions that: 
1. Reversed the lyrics to in the array and printed them out 
2. Printed out every other word in the array
3. Reversed every two lyrics and printed out the entire array when finished

The exercise helped me familiarize myself with the many methods of Arrays and the logistics of manipulating arrays with these methods,
