This exercise was created to work with functions. The parameters are as follows: 
1. Write a function that accepts two numbers as parameters and returns the sum. 
2. Write a funciton that accepts three numbers as parameters and returns the largest of those numbers. 
3. Write a function that accepts one number as a parameters and returns whether that number is even or odd
4. Write a function that accepts a string as a parameter. If the length of the string is less than or equal to twenty characters long - return the string concatenated with iteself. If it is larger than 20 characters return the first half of the string. 

The exercise helped me by practicing with logistical programming and creating functions with conditionals

In addition - we were to create a fibonacci sequence finder that would print a set number of the fibonacci sequence. 

As extra extra credit we also were to create a quadratic equation solver as one of our functions - this one was not finished.
