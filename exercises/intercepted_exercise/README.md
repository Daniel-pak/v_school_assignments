This exercise was created to work with the backend of programming - specifically server and middleware. 

The purpose of the exercise was to create middleware that the server would use and would change the pushed information or request body to something of your choosing. 

This exercise taught me the purpose of middleware and how they can be used. In addition - the importance of the order of the middleware in the server as well as next function() in middleware function creation.
