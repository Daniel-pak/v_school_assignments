This exercise was created for practice with angular directives and services. 

The premise of the exercise was to create a website with a form and allow users to input "ugly things" and show them in a nicely displayed and laid out website.

The exercise allowed me to create a good foundation with basic angular directives and serivces as well as learn the logistics and uses of track by $index.
