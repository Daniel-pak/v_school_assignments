This exercise was created to practice with creating services and directives. 

The purpose of this exercise was to create a form that allowed users to add characters and their names. Using our own created directives and services we are supposed to create an interactive and nicely designed webpage. 

This exercise allowed me to create a solid foundation in creating services and directives.
