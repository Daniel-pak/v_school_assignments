This exercise was created for practice with loops. 

The premise of the exercise was to create: 
1. A loop that would take a string and print every single letter of the string separately.
2. A loop that would take an array of numbers and a target number and return if the number was found or not. 
3. A loop that would search a string for a target letter and return if the letter was found in the string or not. 
4. A loop that would check the numbers of an array and return the smallest number. 

The exercise allowed for great practice with for loops and taught the syntax with repetition.
