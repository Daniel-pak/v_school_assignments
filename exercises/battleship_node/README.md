This exercise was created to familiarize ourselves with node.js. 

The premise of the exercise was to create a battleship game using node. 

This was done by creating an object constructor in the location.js file. This then populated the gameBoard through a for loop in a for loop. This allowed 100 populated spots each with their distinct properties. Then readline-sync allows the user to choose each spot using index numbers. When three boats or locations are hit, the user wins. 

This exercise helped me get familiar with the node.js system - including downloading packages with npm - and working with functional and object oriented programming.
