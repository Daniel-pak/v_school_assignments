            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>I started coding on and off 3 years ago while attending St. John's University. While the Sciences used to be my passion coding, and the ability to create a fully function application within hours, soon overtook that as my main focus. Since then, I've decided to take time away from working to put all of my time into web developement. I joined V School, and since have been coding every day since! I don't have a vast amount of projects to show yet, however, there is much more to come!</p>
