            <h5>The Moves - The event finder</h5>
            <p>A full stack application that allows people to find events - by name and by keyword category types - as well as create them if they are signed up as a business user. As a user, you can save events, look up more information on said event through links and a small blurb, and search for the location on a map.  The application uses user authentication to allow sign in and sign out, Google Maps API, and Materialize styling to bring a real application feeling.
