            <h5>Foodie - The Next Big Recipe Finder</h5>
            <p>Foodie is a full CRUD application that allows users to search for recipes through ingredient, category, or by hot items of the day and save these recipes to look up for later. The application uses a RESTful API through angular http requests to allow my AngularJS client to display this information in a nicely bootstrapped website. The website was built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular, and Node.js (Express).</p>
